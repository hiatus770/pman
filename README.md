A cli tool for storing passwords locally         
```

This was a project made out of curiosity as to how actual password managers work and to sort of find an alternative while learning something new. Currently uses PBKDF2 with 100k iterations along with aes algorithms for storing passwords securely. 

Currently this is only supported on linux.
